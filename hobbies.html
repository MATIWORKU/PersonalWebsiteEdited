                    <img src="./assets/Image/4.jpg" alt="books">One of my favourite things to in my free time is reading. I like to read book because since ou education and also our surrounding teachs us a lot of things 
                    one can learn many more from books. It helps me concentrate my ideas and to think out of the books. I like to read fictions, researches, books about my field etc..... 
                    It is said a reader lives a thousand lives before he dies and i hope to achive that.

                    <img src="./assets/Image/9.jpg" alt="Dallol">Site seeing is one of the most amazing things in this world. Especially in our country there are a lot of places built by our ancestors that makes it difficult to believe the history of how they were made.
                    This site helps us to appericiate who we are and where in the world we come from. It also help us to understand our past and what we must do to protect this legacy that we have.
